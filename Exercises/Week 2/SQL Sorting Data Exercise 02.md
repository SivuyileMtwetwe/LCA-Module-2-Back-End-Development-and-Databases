# ** WEEK 2 SQL Exercise: Sorting, Restricting, and Wildcards with Library Data**

## **Overview**

This exercise will help you practice SQL concepts such as **sorting data (ORDER BY)**, **restricting data (LIMIT & OFFSET)**, and **using wildcards (LIKE)**. You will use a library database with two tables: `books` and `authors`. The tasks will test your ability to query, manipulate, and retrieve specific data using these concepts. You will also apply basic SQL operations like **DDL** and **DML**.

---

## **Instructions**

1. Create a new database called `library_db`.
2. Complete all tasks below.
3. Submit your SQL solution as a `.sql` file on the LMS.
4. Include comments in your SQL code explaining each step.
