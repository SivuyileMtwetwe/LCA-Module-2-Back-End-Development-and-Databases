# **Week 2 Exercise: Applying SQL Joins and Basic Operations**

## **Overview**

This exercise will help you practice SQL joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `CROSS JOIN`), as well as SQL operations such as creating, updating, and deleting records. Additionally, you will apply **DDL**, **DML**, and **DCL** commands to modify and secure your database. Submit your solution as a `.sql` file on the LMS.

---

## **Instructions**

1. Create a new database called `bright_future_company` in MySQL Workbench.
2. Complete all six tasks below using the provided keywords.
3. Include comments in your `.sql` file explaining each step.

     - `Salary` (DECIMAL(10, 2))
     - `Email` (VARCHAR(100))
     - `Phone` (VARCHAR(15))

   - **Departments Table:**
     - `Department_ID` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
     - `Department_Name` (VARCHAR(100))
     - `Location` (VARCHAR(50))

**Keywords to use:** `CREATE DATABASE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `AUTO_INCREMENT`.

2. Delete the record of **Zanele Molefe** from the employees table.  

**Keywords to use:** `UPDATE`, `SET`, `WHERE`, `DELETE`.

---

### **Task 5: Filter and Aggregate Data**

1. Write a query to list all employees earning more than `40,000` along with their department names.  
2. Write a query to count the total number of employees in each department and the total salary paid per department.  

**Keywords to use:** `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `HAVING`.

---

### **Task 6: Bonus Challenge**
